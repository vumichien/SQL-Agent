2. ✅ Setup test infrastructure (fixtures, helpers, configuration)
3. ✅ Create authentication flow tests (register, login, logout)
4. ✅ Create query workflow tests (question → SQL → results → chart)
5. ✅ Create history management tests
6. ✅ Create training data management tests
7. ✅ Create UI feature tests (theme, language, responsive)
8. ✅ Configure cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, Webkit)
9. ✅ Setup test scripts and documentation

---

## BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Use Data Test IDs**: Prefer `[data-testid]` selectors
2. **Wait for Elements**: Always wait for visibility before interaction
3. **Clean State**: Independent tests with cleanup
4. **Use Fixtures**: Authentication fixture for authenticated tests
5. **Mock Appropriately**: API mocks for faster, reliable tests
6. **Proper Timeouts**: Appropriate timeouts for different operations
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of expected errors
8. **Accessibility**: Tests include accessibility checks
9. **Performance**: Tests check page load times
10. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline comments

---

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Backend Dependency**: Tests require backend server to be running
2. **Database State**: Tests create data that may persist
3. **Timing**: Some tests may be sensitive to system performance
4. **Network**: Tests assume local network connectivity

---

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add screenshot comparison
2. **API Mocking Layer**: More sophisticated API mocking
3. **Test Data Fixtures**: Standardized test data sets
4. **Performance Metrics**: Collect and track performance metrics
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Automated a11y testing with axe
6. **Code Coverage**: Instrument frontend for coverage
7. **Parallel Execution**: Optimize for faster test runs
8. **Docker Integration**: Run tests in Docker containers

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Tests timing out:**
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check backend server is running
- Verify network connectivity

**Authentication failures:**
- Clear browser storage between runs
- Check backend auth endpoints
- Verify unique usernames (uses timestamps)

**Element not found:**
- Add explicit waits
- Check element selectors
- Use Playwright Inspector: `--debug`

**Flaky tests:**
- Replace `waitForTimeout` with `waitForSelector`
- Check for race conditions
- Ensure proper cleanup

## NOTES

### Implementation Notes

- All tests use TypeScript for type safety
- Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Fixtures provide reusable authentication logic
- Tests are organized by feature area
- Cross-browser testing ensures compatibility
- Mobile tests verify responsive design

### Performance

- Test execution time: ~5-10 minutes (all browsers)
- Parallel execution reduces overall time
- Mocking speeds up tests where appropriate
- Automatic retry on failure improves reliability

**Task Completed**: 2025-10-27
**Next Task**: TASK 28 (Docker & Production Deployment)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

All E2E tests have been successfully implemented with comprehensive coverage across authentication, query workflow, history management, training data, and UI features. The test suite is ready for CI/CD integration and production use.
